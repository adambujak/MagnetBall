@par Example Description 

Guide through the configuration steps to program internal Flash memory bank 1
and bank 2, and to swap between both of them by mean of the FLASH HAL API.

================================================================================
WARNING : This example is intended to be used only on STM32L07xx/STM32L08xx 
devices with a RevID at least equal to 0x2008. The RevId can be retrieved via 
the function HAL_GetREVID().
================================================================================ 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 32 MHz. 

Below are the steps to run this example:
1- Choose the FLASH_DualBoot_Bank2 project and generate its binary(ie: FLASH_DualBoot.bin)

2- Configure the Flash memory at Dual Bank mode using STM32 ST-LINK Utilities 
   (Target -> Options Bytes) ( "BFB2" should be unchecked). Load this binary at the bank2 of 
   the flash(at the address 0x08100000) using STM32 ST-LINK Utilities(www.st.com) or any 
   similar tool.

@note:
 - You can avoid step 1 by directly loading the binary file provided with the example
 - You have to configure your preferred toolchain in order to generate the binary
   file after compiling the project.
   
 - You can use STM32 ST-LINK Utilities or any similar tool to initially reset the 
   BFB2 bit (disable the dual boot feature). 
   
3- Choose the FLASH_DualBoot_Bank1 project and run it, this project will be loaded
   in the bank1 of the flash: at the address 0x08000000
   
4- Click the BUTTON_TAMPER button to swap between the two banks

- If program in bank1 is selected, a message with a blue text back color will be 
  displayed on LCD and LED1 will remain toggling while LED2 is turn on.

- If program in bank2 is selected, a message with a red text back color will be 
  displayed on LCD and LED2 will remain toggling while LED1 is turn on.

- If error occurs LED3 is turn on.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L07xx and STM32L08xx devices. (Refer to the warning at the beginning
    of this readme.txt)
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L073Z-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to generate the .bin file with MDK-ARM project, you must follow the steps listed below:
  - Open the Project.uvprojx project
  - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
  - Go to "/FLASH_DualBoot\MDK-ARM" directory and run "axftobin.bat" (Fromelf Exe path might have to be 
    updated in "axftobin.bat" file, according to your Keil setup).
  - A binary file "FLASH_DualBoot_Bank2.bin" will be generated under "FLASH_DualBoot_Bank2" folder.

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
