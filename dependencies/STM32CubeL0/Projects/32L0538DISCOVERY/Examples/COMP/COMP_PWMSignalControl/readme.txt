@par Example Description 
  
How to configure a comparator peripheral to automatically hold the TIMER PWM output
in the safe state (low level) as soon as the comparator output is set to a high
level.

  - COMP1 is configured as following:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
     - Output is internally connected to LPTIM 
     
     
LPTIM generates a PWM at the lowest power consumption, using the output signal of 
Comparator.

  - While PA1 is higher than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PB2.
  - While PA1 is lower than VREFINT, PB2 is in low level.
  
The Autorelaod equal to 99 so the output frequency (OutputFrequency) will
be equal to the external counter clock (InputFrequency) divided by (99+1).

  OutputFrequency = InputFrequency / (Autoreload + 1)
                  = InputFrequency / 100

Pulse value equal to 49 and the duty cycle (DutyCycle) is computed as follow:

  DutyCycle = 1 - [(PulseValue + 1)/ (Autoreload + 1)]
  DutyCycle = 50%

  - External square signal should be connected to PA1 (Inverting input of COMP1),
    when the amplitude is higher than 1.22V, PWM signal is displayed on PB2, otherwise PB2 is in low level.

  - Connect an oscilloscope to LPTIM PB2 to display waveforms.
                         
@note To have a precise value of the pulse, HSI as a source of clock system should be 
calibrated or use an external clock.

If LED3 is toggling successively: This indicates that the system generates an error. 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L053xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L0538-DISCO RevB  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L0538-DISCO Set-up
    - Use LED3 connected to PB4 pin.
    - Connect an external signal to PA.01 pin.
    - Connect the scope to PB2 to display the PWM signal.
       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
