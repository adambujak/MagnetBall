@par Example Description 

How to use a DMA channel to transfer data buffer from RAM memory to DAC.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 2 MHz.

DMA1 channel1 is configured to transfer the contents of a Half word data 
buffer stored in RAM memory to the DAC peripheral.

The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA1 channel1 memory-to-peripheral
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA1 channel1.

The DAC channel conversion is configured to be triggered by TIM6 TRGO triggers 
and without noise/triangle wave generation.
12bit right data alignment is selected.

PA4 pin should be connected to the scope to display the sine wave form.

STM32L0538-DISCO board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED3 Toggles when there is an error in the transfer process or in initialisation 
                                 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L053xx devices..
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L0538-DISCO RevB  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM32L0538-DISCO Set-up 	
     - Use LED3 connected to PB4.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) pin to an oscilloscope.    


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
