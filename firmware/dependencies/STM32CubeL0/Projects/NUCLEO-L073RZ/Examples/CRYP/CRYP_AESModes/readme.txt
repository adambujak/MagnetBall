@par Example Description 

How to use the CRYP peripheral to encrypt and decrypt data using AES in chaining
modes (ECB, CBC, CTR).

In this example, the following key size is used: 128.

For this example, a firmware is used to interface with the Crypto peripheral
in polling mode.

This example behaves as follows:

1. ECB mode:
   - AES128 ECB encryption
   - AES128 ECB decryption
2. CBC mode:
   - AES128 CBC encryption
   - AES128 CBC decryption
3. CTR mode:
   - AES128 CTR encryption
   - AES128 CTR decryption


The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC
HyperTerminal using the UART.
Other option terminal IO mode is only available for EWARM IAR tool chain 
(not available on ARM KEIL or SW4STM32 tool chain): Then the Plain data,
encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on debugger terminal IO
by uncomment following line in main file: 
/*#define TERMINAL_IO_OUT*/

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L083xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L073RZ-Nucleo Rev C board with socket using STM32L083xx plugged-in  
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
@note: USUART1(COM1) is mapped on GPIO PA9(TX) and PA10(RX) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
