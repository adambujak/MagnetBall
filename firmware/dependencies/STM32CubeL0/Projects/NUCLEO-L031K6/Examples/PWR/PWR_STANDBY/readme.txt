@par Example Description 
 
How to enter the Standby mode and wake up from this mode by using an external 
reset or the WKUP pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 2 MHz.
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.

After a reset (or wake-up from STANDBY mode), LED3 is ON and MCU is in RUN mode.
The system enters STANDBY mode after 5s, LED3 is OFF.
A rising edge on wakeup pin WKUP3 PA.02 (Arduino A7) will wake-up the system from STANDBY.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.
The LED3 Blinks once in order to indicate the system was resumed from Standby mode.
These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.


@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M0+ core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L031xx and STM32L041xx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L031K6-Nucleo
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32L031K6-Nucleo Set-up
    - LED3 connected to PB.03 pin.
    - Put a Jumper between PA.02 (Arduino A7) and 5V to generate a rising edge on PWR_WAKEUP_PIN3.
    - Connect an ampere-meter to JP1 instead of the jumper to measure the IDD current.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
